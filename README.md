# Motion-sensor
- The LEDs light up when someone passes the sensor and counts the time they were active, showing the total time. As soon as the sensor is active it starts counting, the sensor turns off and it stops, the sensor turns on again it starts to counts but starts from where it left off last time, thus showing the total time the sensors were active
